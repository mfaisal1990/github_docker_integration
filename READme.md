### What is Github Actions?
A **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automation tool built directly into GitHub which allows to automate tasks in your software development lifecycle right from the GitHub repository.

#### Key Points:

Automatically run tasks like tests, builds, and deployments when events happen in your repository (e.g., push, pull request, issue created).

**Workflow Files:**</br>
Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in .github/workflows/ directory.

**Customizable Jobs:**</br>
You can define jobs with multiple steps.

**Marketplace:**</br>
Thousands of pre-built actions are available on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.
