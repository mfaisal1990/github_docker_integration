Working on the READme file to get it completed.

### What is Github Actions?
A **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automation tool built directly into GitHub which allows to automate tasks in your software development lifecycle right from the GitHub repository.

#### Key Points:
- **Automate Workflows:**
Automatically run tasks like tests, builds, and deployments when events happen in your repository (e.g., push, pull request, issue created).
- **Workflow Files:**
Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in .github/workflows/ directory.
- **Customizable Jobs:**
You can define jobs with multiple steps.
- **Marketplace:**
Thousands of pre-built actions are available on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.
